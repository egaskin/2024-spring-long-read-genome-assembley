# 2024-spring-long-read-genome-assembly

We did a case study of long read genome assembly in Python. We attempted to assemble Oxford Nanopore long reads from the bacterium *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serotype Hadar, archived at the National Library of Medicineâ€™s Sequence Read Archive under run ID SRR27959541. We also developed multiple test datasets to test various aspects of our algorithm. Check out our [report](https://github.com/egaskin/2024-spring-long-read-genome-assembly/blob/main/report.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/egaskin/2024-spring-long-read-genome-assembly/blob/main/presentation.pdf)!
